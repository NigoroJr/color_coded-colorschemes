# color_coded-colorschemes

## Description

Vim colorschemes updated for
[color_coded](https://github.com/jeaye/color_coded).

## Included colorschemes

- [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
- [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)

## Using

```vim
NeoBundle 'NigoroJr/color_coded-colorschemes'
```

## Caveats

Following the naming convention used for the "twilighted" theme bundled with
color_coded, "ed" is unconditionally appended to name of the original
colorschemes, like "solarizeded", because that is absolutely proper English.

## Credits and License

[color_coded](https://github.com/jeaye/color_coded) for the plugin.

License is the same as the original colorscheme that it was based off of.

[Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) has a gorgeously
awesome color wheel.
